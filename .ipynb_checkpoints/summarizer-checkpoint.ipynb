       "'  Thank you for inviting me.  Well, Alison, these days global supply chains as you mentioned, are very complex.  And that’s firms tend to rely on a network of suppliers for components or subassemblies or raw materials.  And because we have experienced an era of rapid globalization, which has really been marked by really low cost and very convenient communications, and shipping, firms have tended to cast a wide net geographically when looking for sources of supply.  Oh certainly.  We’ve seen a number of examples of these which have served as a warning.  So, for example, back in 2011, the East Japan earthquake and tsunami took off a number of suppliers in Japan – around Naka, Japan – offline.  And some of those suppliers were critical for these supply chains.  For example, there was one company there who made the material that made automotive black paint sparkle.  Well, we have a lot of talk about how people need to build more resilient supply chains.  And I think this is a good opportunity for people to go back and examine their supply chains and understand where the vulnerabilities are.  But I think consumers, especially in this post pandemic recession, aren’t going to want to necessarily pay more.  So, I think that causes the dilemma for a lot of companies.  Well, I think the first step obviously is mapping your supply chain.  And while that sounds obvious, it’s actually a much harder task than most people appreciate.  And the reason is because these days with kind of the division of labor and specialization of many firms inside the supply chain, we have many tiers.  Risk assessment is really key.  Because as you look through those tiers then you can say, well, how easy is it for me to substitute somebody else?  Are there alternative sources of supply?  Find those ones where they have a high revenue impact to me, if one or more of those suppliers is unable to deliver for whatever reason.  Process improvement is my favorite one.  Especially for companies like in high cost regions like the U.S. or Europe.  If you think about why manufacturers outsourced their supply to Asia or East Asia, or South Asia in the first point, place, it was to save costs.  Well, I think one of the things that I’ve observed in this pandemic and the recession that’s going with it, is that companies who use the crisis as a way of unfreezing their ways of working, unfreezing their organizational processes, adopting new ways of doing things.  Those are the ones who I think can survive and thrive.   It’s going to take using all these things.  I don’t think there’s any one thing that, there’s any one solution that everybody will be able to apply.  It’s going to depend on your sector and what kind of alternatives you might be able to develop and how long will that take to develop?  There’s a lot of impatience about this supply chain resilience and reshoring.  I like to remind people that it took 20 to 25 years for China to capture the supply chain in many products.  And if you want to move the supply chain, we’re not talking about something that will happen in a year, or a couple of years.  You know, it’s kind of a two-way street.  People are finding they were far too over dependent on a particular sector, or particular manufacturer.  That says diversification is one route you can take in terms of I want to diversify my customers, I want to diversify the sectors that I serve.  We’ve seen a lot of pivots where firms have really moved into, moved into new areas, moved into new ways of serving customers as well.  So, it goes back to, I have to unfreeze my organizational ways of working and think about new things that I can do with those capabilities, new opportunities I can address.  Well, even software and services businesses have adopted global footprints as well.  And we’re not just talking about Asia or South Asia, but we’re seeing software companies having part of their footprint in Eastern Europe for example, or Ireland, or lots of different places.  I think the key steps are really first understand what are your risks?  One of the things that I think has been very gratifying that I have seen in the pandemic is how the crisis has unfrozen how a lot of companies act.  So, a great example has been in medical ventilators.  I’m on a board of a company that manufacturers a lot of medical equipment for other companies and they came to us and many companies came to them saying, how fast can you put ventilators into production for us?  Thank you.'"

And because we have experienced an era of rapid globalization, which has really been marked by really low cost and very convenient communications, and shipping, firms have tended to cast a wide net geographically when looking for sources of supply.\n",
