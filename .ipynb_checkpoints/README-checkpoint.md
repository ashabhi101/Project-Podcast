# Project-Podcast

## Concept:

The idea behind this project is to summarize the learnings of a podcast and even automate it to generate the summary for podcast makers ( if sustainable). Apart from that, perform some data analysis to determine interesting things about the transcript data.

Some concepts like:
    List the number of speakers in the podcast
    What kind of podcast is it, more business related or economical or ( topic modelling)
    Are the answers short or long
    Wordcloud
    Sentiment in their general views (Are they more positive or negative about the topic, Sentiment Analysis)
